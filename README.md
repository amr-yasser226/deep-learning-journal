# Deep Learning Journal

This repository serves as a professional, chronological record of my deep learning education. It captures all notebooks, code samples, experiments, and detailed notes that reflect both completed studies and ongoing exploration.

Every entry documents the concepts and techniques I have mastered, as well as areas currently under investigation. By maintaining these materials in a single location, I ensure reproducibility, clear organization of my progress, and a transparent view of my evolving understanding of neural network theory and practice.

All resources are presented in Jupyter notebook format with accompanying narrative explanations to illustrate objectives, methodologies, and outcomes. This collection is intended for self‑review, collaboration, and reference as I advance through foundational principles to cutting‑edge architectures.
